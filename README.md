# Multi File Renamer

## This java app allows you to rename multiple files at once with with features to add prefixes and suffixes and search/replace with regex

## Ideas for future features:
- A way to set the default folder path
- Option to match entire words with search/replace
- A way to search for files ("find in files" is already implemented, but not used)
- A way to sort files
- A way to number files
